Apollofy is a popular digital music streaming platform that offers a vast collection of tracks, albums, podcasts, and other audio content.

The frontend of the application is built with React + Vite + Typescript. 
You can show it at server folder.

In the user interface, you will be able to view all added tracks in a list. Each track will be displayed with its name, poster, score, and genre. There will be an option to add new tracks through a modal or a new page, where you can enter the track's name, upload a poster image, assign a Artist'name, and select a genre. You will also have the option to update the data of existing tracks or remove them from the list.

- The Backend of the application is built with Node + typescript + MongoDB + Prisma + Cloudinary. 

Although the frontend of the application is important for user interaction, the main focus of this project is the backend. As you progress through the project, you will learn and apply different backend technologies and concepts, including Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Auth0, and Cloudinary. You will learn how these technologies work together to support the functionalities of the application and provide a smooth user experience.

# Front-End Libraries and Dependencies

- Vite: Vite is a fast and lightweight build tool and development server for modern web projects. It offers near-instantaneous development server startup and quick HMR (Hot Module Replacement) updates, making it an excellent choice for React applications.

- React: As mentioned earlier, React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- TypeScript: TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, making the development process more productive and the codebase more robust.

- react-h5-audio-player: This library provides an HTML5 audio player component for React, making it easy to play audio files in the application.

- react-icons: A library that offers a vast collection of customizable icons for React applications, making it simple to include icons in the UI.

- react-loader-spinner: This library provides a variety of loading spinners for React, enhancing the user experience during data loading.

- react-multi-select-component: This library allows you to create multi-select components in React, making it easier to handle multiple selections in your application.

- react-router-dom: React Router is used to handle navigation and routing in the application, enabling smooth transitions between different pages.

- react-spring: React Spring is a library for animating React components, allowing for smooth and fluid animations in the application.

- react-transition-group: React Transition Group is another library for creating smooth animations and transitions between React components.

- styled-components: Styled-components is a popular CSS-in-JS library that allows you to write CSS directly in your React components using tagged template literals.

- swiper: Swiper is a modern carousel/slider library that enables you to create responsive and touch-friendly sliders for your application.

## Development Dependencies
- @types/react: TypeScript type definitions for React.

- @types/react-dom: TypeScript type definitions for React DOM.

- @types/react-transition-group: TypeScript type definitions for React Transition Group.

- @types/swiper: TypeScript type definitions for Swiper.

- @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin: ESLint plugin for TypeScript.

- @typescript-eslint/parser: TypeScript parser for ESLint.

- @vitejs/plugin-react: Vite plugin for React.

- eslint: ESLint for code linting.

- eslint-plugin-react-hooks: ESLint plugin for enforcing React Hooks rules.

- eslint-plugin-react-refresh: ESLint plugin for React Refresh.

- typescript: TypeScript for static typing.

- vite: Vite for fast development and building.

# Clone the Repository

To get a local copy of the application, follow these steps:

Open your terminal or command line.

Clone the repository by executing the following command:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/JorgeMunarriz/Music-App-Player-Apollofy.git
```


Access the project directory:

```bash
cd Music-App-Player-Apollofy
```

## Install Dependencies
Before running the application, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. Then, install the dependencies using npm or yarn (make sure to have yarn installed beforehand):


```bash
npm install
``` 

or 

```bash
yarn install
```

# Run the Server (Simulating Backend)
The Apollofy app uses server to simulate a backend for fetching data. To run the server, use the following command:

```bash
cd server
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn dev
```



# Run the Application
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application in local development mode with the following command:

```bash
cd client
```


```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will launch the application in your browser at http://localhost:5173

# Additional Scripts

```bash
npm run build
```

build: This script is responsible for compiling your TypeScript code into JavaScript. It uses rimraf to delete the dist folder (if it exists) and then uses tsc (TypeScript Compiler) to compile the TypeScript files in the src folder and generate the dist folder with the compiled JavaScript files. You can execute this script using npm run build.

```bash
npm run start
```

start: This script first runs the npm run build command, which compiles the TypeScript files into JavaScript in the dist folder. Then, it executes the index.js file located in the dist folder using node. In short, this script starts your application in production mode. To run this script, simply type npm start in your terminal.

Remember that to be able to run these scripts, you need to be in the directory of your project and have Node.js installed. Then, simply type the corresponding command in your terminal to execute each script according to your needs. For example, npm run dev for development mode or npm start for production mode.
Feel free to explore and enjoy the Apollofy app! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
